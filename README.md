## ✨ About the Project

### 🎯 Inspiration
We live in a world where digital permanence is the norm—everything we say, type, or share is logged somewhere. But sometimes, you just want to express something and forget about it. Maybe it's a bad day, a thought you regret, or a feeling too heavy to carry.

**MentalFlush** is inspired by the idea of letting go—digitally. It’s a quirky, minimalist app where you can write anything on your mind, then **flush** it away, never to be seen again.

> "Because some memories are better left unarchived."
